## Introduction

The system is divided along four binary orthogonal personality dimensions, altogether comprising a total of a 16 distinct personality types.The dimensions are the following:

- Extraversion (E) vs Introvertion (I): a measure of how much an individual prefers their outer or inner world. 
- Sensing (S) vs Intuition (N): a measure of how much an individual processes information through the five senses versus impressions through patterns.
- Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F): a measure of preference for objective principles and facts versus weighing the emotional perspectivers of others. 
- Judging (J) vs Perceiving (P): a measure of hoe much an individual prefers a planned ans ordered life versus a flexible and spontaneous life.
